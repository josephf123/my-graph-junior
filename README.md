# About

My graph junior is a way to help organise and improve your life. Its first iteration is a simple note taking app with features such as tagging and sorting. Later iterations will introduce machine learning and a open ended structure that will aid in the vast amount of data you create.

This project uses typescript and react as the frontend and firebase as the backend
